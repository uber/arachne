Arachne for Debian
------------------

Arachne is Uber's framework of in-house developed, strategically distributed, light-weight server agents that,
in an always-on and active fashion, perform end-to-end functional testing of all the network connected
infrastructure components and, on top of that, monitor the health of the DC and Cloud infrastructure and
can discern between an infrastructure issue and an application issue.
Arachne is a packet loss detection system and an underperforming path detection system that is able to detect
the following intra-DC, inter-DC, DC-to-Cloud, and DC-to-External-Services issues by generating minimal
traffic that is the ‘closest’ to the typical type of traffic an Uber application generates:
- Reachability
- Round-trip and 1-way (Avg, Best, Worst, StDev) Latency
- Silent packet drops and black holes
- Jitter (average of the deviation from the network mean latency)
- PMTU or Firewall issues too related possibly to network config changes (accidental or not)
- Network-level SLAs are met?

Arachne runs on Linux and Darwin (Mac OS X).
