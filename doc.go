Package arachne provides a packet loss detection system and an underperforming
path detection system. It provides fast and easy active end-to-end functional
testing of all the components in Data Center and Cloud infrastructures.
Arachne is able to detect intra-DC, inter-DC, DC-to-Cloud, and
DC-to-External-Services issues by generating minimal traffic:

  - Reachability
  - Round-trip and 1-way latency
  - Silent packet drops and black holes
  - Jitter (average of the deviation from the network mean latency)
  - PMTU or Firewall issues too related possibly to network config changes
    (accidental or not)
  - Network-level SLAs are met?
